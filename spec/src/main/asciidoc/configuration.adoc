== Configuration

OpenTelemetry MUST be configured by MicroProfile Config following the semantics of configuration properties detailed in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/v{otel-java-version}/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure[OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure {otel-java-version}].

[[sec:service-loader-support]]
=== Service Loader Support

Implementation will load additional configuration related components by means of service loader.
This allows the application or runtime extender to define their own metadata and trace / metrics / log handling behavior.
The following components are supported
