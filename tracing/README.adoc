= MicroProfile Telemetry

This specification is to adopt https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] from CNCF to allow MicroProfile Applications benefit from OpenTelemetry and enable Jakarta RESTful Web Services automatically being traced if configured.

== OpenTracing move to OpenTelemetry
With the merge of OpenTracing and OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry holds the future. OpenTelemetry consists of Tracing, Logging and Metrics support.
This `tracing` directory only focuses on the tracing aspect.

== Directly adopt the APIs from OpenTelemetry Tracing

This specification directly expose the Tracing APIs from OpenTelemetry and then provide CDI and Jakarta RESTful Web Services integration.
The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/api/all/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/api/trace Tracer APIs from OpenTelemetry will be exposed.
This specification does not plan to reinvent the wheels but rather exposes OpenTelemetry APIs due to the following reasons:

* OpenTelemetry is a specification under CNCF
* OpenTelemetry is widely adopted by different vendors and languages
* OpenTelemetry has Java API and annotations that are readily to be used
* OpenTelemetry is active and open for the collaboration with us
* OpenTelemetry is platform technology and we use the effort to make Java libraries to be used directly instead of reinventing our own APIs
* OpenTelemetry has broad vendor support. Many APMs are contributing to the spec, providing a guarantee that traces can be used out of the box, with minimal integrations.
* OpenTelemetry is serious with backward incompatible changes and communicates openly

MicroProfile Telemetry pulls in a particular version of OpenTelemetry.
Whenever we upgrade, we evaluate the backward compatibility status ourselves as well.

== MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing
MicroProfile Telemetry pulls in OpenTelemetry Tracing and integrate with CDI and Jakarta Restful Services. It provides three types of instrumentations:

* Automatic Instrumentation

Jakarta RESTful Web Services (server and client), and MicroProfile REST Clients are automatically enlisted to participate in distributed tracing without code modification as specified in the Tracing API.

* Manual Instrumentation

Explicit manual instrumentation can be added into a MicroProfile application using annotation or programmatic lookup.

* Agent Instrumentation

Implementations are free to support the OpenTelemetry Agent Instrumentation.

=== Configuration
By default, MicroProfile Telemetry tracing is off. In order to enable any of the tracing aspects, the configuration `mp.telemetry.trace.enabled=true` must be specified in any of the config sources available via MicroProfile Config.

CAUTION: This is different from the OpenTelemetry standard

This property is read once when the application is starting. Any changes afterwards will not take effect unless the application is restarted.
